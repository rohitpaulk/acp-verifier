label: Displays terminal output
description: Leaves terminal output visible to the user through terminal content embedded in tool calls

This check verifies that terminal output remains displayable in ACP session updates. Agents can satisfy this with embedded client-managed terminal content, or with ACP `execute` tool call content that includes the command result.

### Why is this important?

Users need to see the command output that led to the agent's next steps, especially for test failures, build errors, and generated logs. Terminal or `execute` tool call content lets clients display this output directly in the conversation.
